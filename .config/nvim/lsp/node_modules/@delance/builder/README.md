        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that

## But waitâ€¦

> Isn't this against the original LICENSE?

**tl;dr: yes.** You choose to break the binding agreement of the original
software, but this repo itself does not violate any rights of its corresponding
copyright authors: it's a standalone piece of software that is not tied to,
nor redistributes any other particular project in the question.
