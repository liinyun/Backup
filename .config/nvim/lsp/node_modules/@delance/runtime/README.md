See [@delance/builder](https://git.sr.ht/~self/delance-builder#contributing).

Ensure linting and type checking passes,
and send your patches to <~self/delance-devel@lists.sr.ht>.

You shall sign off your contribution with a `Signed-off-by` tag appended to
the log message of the patch or the tip of a Git branch containing

By contributing, you agree to both the [license] and the terms below:

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
	are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
	personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
	maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
	this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## But waitâ€¦

> Isn't this against the original LICENSE?

**tl;dr: yes.** You choose to break the binding agreement of the original
software, but this repo itself does not violate any rights of its corresponding
copyright authors: it's a standalone piece of software that is not tied to,
nor redistributes any other particular project in the question.
